* Wide range of both open and closed data sources used
* 2011 base year (in line with Census)
* Python-based processing
* Some run-time issues

  * Particularly car ownership model
 
* Code hosted publicly on GitHub


Background Developments

* Census was updated

  * Mixed years for England & Wales (2020) and Scotland (2021)

* Open-source directive becoming more prominent at TfN

General Approach
----------------

* Open first!

  * Code (already in place!)
  * Documentation

* Consistency with existing TfN setups as widely as possible
* Prioritise openly-available data
